<h3>Act-2 Scene - I (Orgon, Mariane)</h3>
<p>
    <h6>Orgon</h6>
    <p>Mariane</p>
    <h6>Mariane</h6>
    <p>Yes</p>
    <h6>Orgon.</h6>
    <p>Come here. We need to speak Privately.</p>
    <h6>Mariane.</h6>
    <p>Father, what is it you seek?</p>
    <h6>Orgon</h6>
    <p>[looking in the closet]. I'm seeing if anyone can overhear us.
        This is a perfect place for such a purpose.
        There now, it's okay.  Mariane, I find
        You endowed with a heart that's sweet and kind
        And you have always been most dear to me.</p>
    <h6>Mariane.</h6>
    <p>A father's love brings true felicity.</p>
    <h6>Orgon.</h6>
    <p>Well said, my child!  And to earn it fully
        You should devote yourself to contenting me.</p>
    <h6>Mariane.</h6>
    <p>That's how my devotion is put to the proof.</p>
    <h6>Orgon.</h6>
    <p>Good.  Now what do you think of our guest, Tartuffe?</p>
    <h6>Mariane.</h6>
    <p> Who me?</p>
    <h6>Orgon. </h6>
    <p>You.  Think well before you reply.</p>
    <h6>Mariane.</h6>
    <p>Oh my!  Tell me what to say . . . and I'll comply.</p>
